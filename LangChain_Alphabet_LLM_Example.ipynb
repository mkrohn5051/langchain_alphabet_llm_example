Whether our partners are developers, advertisers, content creators, or merchants, our performance is only made possible by their success.\\n\\nFor many of our customers, digital transformation in the cloud became an urgent business priority in 2020. Last year, Google hosted over a trillion minutes of video meetings and over 2.9 billion users chose productivity apps like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Meet every single day.\\n\\nDevelopers were behind the apps that kept people\\n\\nentertained and connected while at home. To ensure developers could access the latest information about our products, and could connect with us and each other, we pivoted all our major conferences online, including 11 weeks of developer content to support the launch of Android 11 Beta. This gave millions of developers easy access to the information they need to build their businesses on Android and Google Play. We also released new tools to help developers build more efficiently and grow their business, as well as online training materials to expand their learning.\\n\\nThe retail sector has faced many challenges over the years, which have only intensified during the pandemic. We made it free for retailers around the world to list products on our Google Shopping tab and removed commission fees for all sellers who participate in our Buy on Google checkout experience. To help retailers adapt to a new reality, we provided a real-time view into search trends relevant to their business in the Google Ads Insights page and made in-demand options like curbside pickup and delivery central features in Search and Maps.\\n\\n$1B\\n\\nQuality journalism and a vibrant news industry\\n\\nIn 2020, we announced our largest investment yet to support the future of news with the launch of Google News Showcase', metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\mkroh\\\\Desktop\\\\alphabet_reports_for_langchain_example\\\\2020_alphabet_annual_report.pdf'}),\n",

In February, when war broke out in Ukraine, our teams worked around-the-clock to make sure our products were helpful to people who needed them, from providing trustworthy information on Search to disrupting cyberattacks to partnering with the government to deploy air raid alerts. In March, I traveled to Warsaw, Poland, where I met Googlers hosting families who sought refuge, talked with entrepreneurs using our office spaces, and saw how our products like Google Translate were helping Ukrainians find a bit of hope and connection.\\n\\nshared new generative models, including Imagen, our text-to-image model, and Phenaki, which can generate long, coherent videos from text prompts.\\n\\nIt’s been especially exciting to see how AI advancements are making our products more helpful. Last year, we launched multisearch, a new way to search using both text and images, and it’s now available in more than 70 languages. People use Lens more than 10 billion times per month to search with their camera or images, and its new, AI-powered translation feature blends translated text seamlessly into the background of images. And, thanks to a new machine learning technique, we added 24 new languages to Google Translate, including its first indigenous languages of the Americas.\\n\\nBy late spring, the tech industry was adjusting to a more challenging macroeconomic environment, and as a company we embarked on efforts to sharpen our focus and make sure our efforts are aligned with our highest priorities. Near the end of the year, AI reached an inflection point, made possible by our foundational breakthroughs like Transformer and advances in diffusion models. It was an exciting moment for us after having worked to develop the technology responsibly for so many years. And on December 18, during the World Cup final, Google Search saw its highest query-per-second volume of all time, a strong signal of our momentum.', metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\mkroh\\\\Desktop\\\\alphabet_reports_for_langchain_example\\\\2022_alphabet_annual_report.pdf'}),\n",

This is a strong recognition of the value of our products, particularly in important and urgent moments. As a few examples, we’ve seen a significant rise in search activity. To put it into perspective, in the U.S., coronavirus-related search activity at its peak was four times greater than during the peak of the Super Bowl. People are spending significantly more time on their Android apps, with downloads of apps from Google Play rising 30% from February to March. YouTube watchtime has also significantly increased. One area in particular is livestreams. I hope you saw Andrea Bocelli on YouTube Live on Easter, which has had over 39 million views. It was truly beautiful. One hundred million students and educators are using Google Classroom, double the number from the beginning of March. We've seen a massive increase in demand for Chromebooks; analysts have reported a 400% increase during the week of March 21st year-over-year. And schools and businesses in particular are using our secure video conferencing platform Meet. Last week, we surpassed a significant milestone and are now adding roughly 3 million new users each day, and have seen a thirty fold increase in usage since January.

We have also helped businesses navigate uncertainty during an uneven economic recovery, and we have worked to address the complex challenge of distributing critical information about COVID-19 vaccines to billions of people around the world. Importantly, we have made authoritative content a key focus area across both Google Search and YouTube to help users find trusted public health information.\\n\\nOther Bets also remain focused on innovation through technology that can positively affect people's lives.
